  <h1><strong>It's All About the Airborne</strong></h1>
  <div class="myyears">
    <p>I served over 17 years in Airborne Units and enjoyed what I did. The first offical Airborne Unit in the United States Army was the famed 82nd Airborne Division. The Division recently celebrated its 100th Anniversy in August 2017. The unit was orignally formed as the 82nd Division in August 1917 and was given the nickname "All-Americans" when it was discovered that they had one man from each state of the Union. SGT Alvin York was a member and won the Congressial Medal of Honor. I deployed to Desert Sheild/Storm with the 82nd as a member of the 82nd Signal Battalion (ABN) and was on the 5 plane that landed in Saudi Arabia, I was the tip of the spear and the line in the sand.</p>

  <p>One of my favorite quotes is by General George S. Patton, Jr. "I am a Soldier, I fight where I am told, and win where I fight."</p>
